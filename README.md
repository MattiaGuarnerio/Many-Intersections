# Many Intersections in Search of an Author
 To whom it may concern,<br><br>
 This repository hosts the R code for reproducing the results and figures from the study _Many Intersections in Search of an Author – An intersectional analysis of material outcomes in job security and early career returns of school-to-work transitions in Germany_.<br><br>
 Original data from CILS4EU-DE (Reduced version) is not open-source, and cannot be included in a public GitHub repository. For replication purposes, CILS4EU-DE data from Waves 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, 8, and 9 must be ordered from the GESIS - Leibniz Institute for the Social Sciences repository.<br><br>
 Therefore, while data tidying and imputation cannot be reproduced without requesting CILS4EU-DE data, data analysis and visualisation can be reproduced through the multiply imputed `imp_main.rds` analytic sample.<br><br>
 Compiled Bayesian MCMC models, each weighing ≈ 1 GB, are available on FileTransfer upon request.<br><br>

 Best regards,<br>
